### Contributing
Just fork this repository, and then send a pull request when you've fixed a bug or added something awesome! I'll check it out as soon as possible and merge it back in. Just try to keep your code neat.

### Upcoming Features
There are a number of things I'd like to add to the extension soon including:
* support for other field identifiers ("name" for instance)
* better auto-detect
* avatar support (image upload maybe?)
